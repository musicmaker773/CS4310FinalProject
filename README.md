# CS4310FinalProject

Here are the steps to run the code after you have downloaded this repository onto your computer:
1. You navigate to this file in the directory of the terminal. 
2. There should be a Makefile made for this project. You type "make" into your terminal and it will make an executable called tcps.
3. Run tcps by typing ./tcps into your terminal. This will run the server.
4. Go to your web browser and go to the top bar of it. Type in either localhost:18000 and press enter or your IP address followed by the port number, 18000. (Ex: XXX.XXX.X.XX:18000).
5. You should be able to see a website that is colored light blue.

Warning:
Do not port forward your IP address to other devices on other networks. Do the server locally. If you port forward onto another device that has a network on a separate modem, you will not have the ability to see the website due to a security reason.
